# EasyMappingKit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Yalantis/EasyMappingKit.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Yalantis/EasyMappingKit)

# Note
This is fork of [EasyMapping](https://github.com/lucasmedeirosleite/EasyMapping) - flexible and easy way of JSON mapping.

# Reason to be
It turns out, that almost all popular libraries for JSON mapping SLOW. The main reason is often trips to database during duplicate lookup. So we decided to take already existing flexible solution and improve overall performance.
